    "# Tuning a diffusion model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be training a tiny diffusion model, track the training process with MLflow, and tune the hyperparameters using Ray Tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A lightning tour of diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely, you have heard of diffusion models. It's the architecture behind DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and many others.\n",
    "Here we are going to look at a particular class of diffusion models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).\n",
    "\n",
    "DDPMs aim to generate high-quality samples from a given distribution, typically modeled as an image distribution. These models are based on the idea of denoising a sequence of noisy samples to reach the target distribution. Let's break down the mathematical explanation of DDPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Foward Diffusion Process:**\n",
    "   DDPM introduces a diffusion process to model the generation of samples. It assumes that the data $x$ evolves over a series of steps from an easily generated distribution to the target distribution. This process is defined by a sequence of transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ x_0 \\sim p(x_0) $$\n",
    "   $$ x_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t} \\cdot x_{t-1} + \\sqrt{\\beta_t} \\cdot \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, $x_0$ is sampled from an easily generated distribution (e.g., a Gaussian distribution), and $\\epsilon_t$ is sampled from a fixed distribution (e.g., Gaussian). The parameter $\\beta_t$ controls the step size of the diffusion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reverse Diffusion Process:**\n",
    "   At each step of the diffusion process, a noise-corrupted version of the data is obtained. The model is then trained to denoise this corrupted sample and estimate the conditional distribution $p_{\\theta}(x_t | x_{t-1})$. The denoising process is typically modeled using a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ p_{\\theta}(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}\\left(x_t; \\mu_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}), \\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_{t-1})\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, $\\mu_{\\theta}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\theta}$ are functions parameterized by the neural network, which outputs the mean and standard deviation of the conditional distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Procedure:**\n",
    "   During training, we corrupt input samples and train the model to de-noise the inputs again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sampling:**\n",
    "   Once the model is trained, sampling from the model involves running the diffusion process forward and denoising at each step to generate high-quality samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDPM combines the diffusion process with a denoising neural network to model complex distributions. The training involves optimizing the model parameters to denoise corrupted samples and generate samples from the target distribution. For an in-depth explanation, we recommend Lilian Weng's blog post [\"What are Diffusion Models?\"](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) and the huggingface blog post [\"The Annotated Diffusion Model\"](https://huggingface.co/blog/annotated-diffusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a DDPM, we need two components: a noise scheduler (that adds & removes noise) and a (denoising) model."

    "### Noise Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "DPPMs feature a forward and a backward diffusion process. The noise scheduler implements the steps for both processes, you can find its implementation in the next cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward diffusion process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward diffusion process, a small amount of (Gaussian) noise is added in $T$ steps. This yields a sequence of noisy samples $x_1, \\dots, x_T$. The step size is controlled by the noise (or variance) schedule $\\{\\beta_t \\in (0, 1)\\}^T_{t=1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a linear noise schedule (the $\\beta$ are linearly spaced). Of course, plenty of other options exist.\n",
    "There's a handy closed-form formula for sampling $x_t$ at any time step, which uses the [reparametrization trick](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#reparameterization-trick): If we define $\\alpha_t = 1 - \\beta_t$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\prod_{i=1}^t \\alpha_i$, it turns out that $x_t$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon_t$ is some isotropic Gaussian noise. This is implemented in the `add_noise` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reverse diffusion process\n",
    "\n",
    "We can recreate the original sample $\\mathbf{x}_0$, if we manage to reverse the process and sample from $q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}\\vert \\mathbf{x}_t)$. Unfortunately, this is not feasible, so we need to learn some model $p_\\theta$ which runs the _denoising_ or _reverse diffusion process_: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\\mathbf{x}_T) \\prod^T_{t=1} p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} \\vert \\mathbf{x}_t) \\quad\n",
    "p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} \\vert \\mathbf{x}_t) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_t, t), \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_t, t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse diffusion process becomes tractable when we condition on $\\mathbf{x}_0$ and one can then derive [\"nice\"](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/#nice) equations for the reverse process, but we'll spare you the Gaussian jugglery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What really matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The details are not important for our application here. What _is_ important is that we already have three hyperparameters: The number of steps $T$ and the initial and final noise levels $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_T$."
