    "In the final part of this lab, we are going to generate synthetic image data. You can think of synthetic data as an extension of augmentation, with the exception that we want to generate completely new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is synthetic data desirable? There are at least two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More high quality data helps us train better models.\n",
    "2. Using synthetic data in lieu of \"natural data\" helps us avoid privacy issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data is a _generative task_. We thus need a model that learns an approximation to the \"true\" distribution that we wish to sample (e.g. all cat images). There are many possible model architectures for this, e.g\n",

    "- Normalizing flows\n",
    "- Diffusion models\n",
    "- ... and probably many more\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one can also generate data in other ways. For instance, a popular approach is to use 3D rendering software like Blender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're using a diffusion model. You have already seen this type of model in a previous lab, so you should be able to complete this lab in a breeze. ;) Diffusion models have also [been found to ]"
