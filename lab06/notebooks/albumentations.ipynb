    "# Augmentation by Albumentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The core tenet of data centric machine learning is prioritizing high-quality, diverse, and relevant data for training models, recognizing its crucial role in model performance and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "One technique that can help you with this is _augmentation_. Augmentation is the process of expanding a dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or noise to the data. This can help increase diversity in datasets, which in turn helps with generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentation is frequently associated with image data, but not exclusive to it. For instance, chemical applications of ML, augmentations such as conformer generation (different spatial arrangements of atoms in molecules) are used frequently. We will stick to images today.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a first glance, augmentation looks very simple. It's really just a few basic transformations on an image. However, there are many pitfalls once masks, labels, boxes etc. get involved. This is why you're better off to use a dedicated augmentation library instead of building your own augmentations from scratch. One such library is [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai).\n",
    "\n",
    "In their own words,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Albumentations is a fast and flexible image augmentation library. The library is widely used in industry, deep learning research, machine learning competitions, and open source projects. Albumentations is written in Python, and it is licensed under the MIT license. The source code is available at <https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations>.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `albumentations` from `pip` like any regular python package. We've already taken care of this in the conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To start our augmentation adventure, we of course need the `albumentations` library. On top of this, we also require a library to read images from the disk. Here, we'll use [`pillow`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)."
