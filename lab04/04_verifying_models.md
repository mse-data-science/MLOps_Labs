# Verification of Models

So far, we have been _testing_ models. However, tests can never _guarantee_ that a property holds. This is especially problematic when trying to examine the reliability of a neural network in the face of adversarial attacks.

In this final part of the lab, we will introduce you to two _verification_ methods - methods that can guarantee that a neural network has a certain property.

## Formal verification terminology

## Complete and unsound: Certification via bound propagation

## Complete and sound: Certification with MiLP
