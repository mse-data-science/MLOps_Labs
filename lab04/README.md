# Continuous testing, integration, delivery, and machine learning

In this lab, you are going to learn about continuous testing, integration, and delivery, and how we can extend this paradigm to machine learning.

We will be using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Continuous Machine Learning (CML)](https://cml.dev/).
This lab is divided into multiple parts:

|  Lab Part  | Description |
|:------------|:-------------|
| [Part 1](01_introduction_to_cicd.md) | Introduction to CI/CD with GitHub Actions |
| [Part 2](02_introduction_to_pytest.md) | Introduction to unit testing with `pytest` |
| [Part 3](03_testing_models.md) | Testing machine learning models |
| [Part 4](04_verifying_models.md) | Verifying machine learning models |
