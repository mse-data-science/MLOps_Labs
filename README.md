# MLOps

This is the repository for the labs/tutorials of the lecture Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), ZHAW BSc Computer Science & Data Science.

## Setup

We use `conda` environments to manage the lab dependencies. Every lab has its own conda environment. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for your platform.

We further recommend **Windows Users** to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as some software we are using does not support Windows.

Finally, it is a good idea to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) as some of the labs contain parts that _benefit_ from Docker (it is not a requirement, though).

### Creating environments with `conda`

Once you have conda installed, you can create an environment from a `env.yaml` file using the following command:

```shell
conda env create -f env.yaml
```

Then, to enter the environment:

```shell
conda activate <environment name>
```

So, for the first lab this command becomes:

```shell
conda activate mlops-lab-01
```
