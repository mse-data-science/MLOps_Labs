## Setup

We use `conda` environments to manage the lab dependencies. Every lab has its own conda environment. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for your platform.

We further recommend **Windows Users** to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as some software we are using does not support Windows.

Finally, it is a good idea to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) as some of the labs contain parts that _benefit_ from Docker (it is not a requirement, though).

### Creating environments with `conda`

Once you have conda installed, you can create an environment from a `env.yaml` file using the following command:

```shell
conda env create -f env.yaml
```

Then, to enter the environment:

```shell
conda activate <environment name>
```

So, for the first lab this command becomes:

```shell
conda activate mlops-lab-01
```

### Running Notebooks

Most labs will make use of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which you can either run locally or on Google Colab. There are of course many other ways to run them, and you are free to use whichever tool and setup you want, but we cannot guarantee compatibility.

Below we show you two ways of running the lab notebooks that are known to work.

**We recommend beginning each lab by running the notebooks locally, and only switching to Colab for longer computations.**
Images sometimes do not render correctly in Colab, and some features might not work as expected.

#### Running locally

To run notebooks locally, proceed as follows:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the lab directory (e.g. `lab01`).
2. Activate the conda environment for this labe (e.g. `mlops-lab-01`).
3. Run `jupyter lab`. This will result in output similar to the following:

```shell

    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///some/long/path/here/jpserver-74325-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/lab?token=token
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=token
```

4. Click on or copy the link and past it in your browser.
5. Now, click on the jupyter notebook of your liking.

#### Running in Google Colab

In the instructions below, replace `token` with

```raw
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
```

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate your browser to [colab.research.google.com](colab.research.google.com).
3. In the menu, select `File > Upload notebook`
![Colab menu](imgs/colab_menu.png)
4. Select the notebook you want to open.
5. Once your notebook is open, add a code cell at the very top. You can do this, by hovering your cursor over the top of the notebook until the `Code` and `Text` buttons appear as shown in the image below:
![Colab hover](imgs/colab_hover.png)
6. In the code cell, add the following:

```shell
!git clone https://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@github.com/bil-y/MLOps_Labs
%cd MLOps_Labs/path/to/notebook
```

where you replace `path/to/notebook` with the path to the jupyter notebook you just opened. For instance, if you opened `lab01a.ipynb`, the statement would become `%cd MLOps_Labs/lab01`.
7. Connect to a GPU by changing the runtime type:
