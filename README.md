# MLOps

This is the repository for the labs/tutorials of the lecture Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), ZHAW BSc Computer Science & Data Science.

## Setup

We use `conda` environments to manage the lab dependencies. Every lab has its own conda environment. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for your platform.

We further recommend **Windows Users** to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as some software we are using does not support Windows.
