    "Previously, you have seen how to use the `transformers` library download state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). In this notebook, we will get a transformer to answer our questions by engineering a suitable prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will be using [`langchain`](), a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Langchain enables context-aware and reasoning language models. We can of course not cover all aspects of `langchain` in a single notebook. Instead, we only cover the bits that we'll need for our demo application.\n",

These operations can be purely random, deterministic or both, and are used to construct new point processes, which can be then also used as mathematical models. The operations may include removing or thinning points from a point process, combining or superimposing multiple point processes into one point process or transforming the underlying space of the point process into another space. Point process operations and the resulting point processes are used in the theory of point processes and related fields such as stochastic geometry and spatial statistics.One point process that gives particularly convenient results under random point process operations is the Poisson point process, The Poisson point process often exhibits a type of mathematical closure such that when a point process operation is applied to some Poisson point process, then provided some conditions on the point process operation, the resulting process will be often another Poisson point process operation, hence it is often used as a mathematical model.Point process operations have been studied in the mathematical limit as the number of random point process operations applied approaches infinity. This had led to convergence theorems of point process operations, which have their origins in the pioneering work of Conny Palm in 1940s and later Aleksandr Khinchin in the 1950s and 1960s who both studied point processes on the real line, in the context of studying the arrival of phone calls and queueing theory in general. Provided that the original point process and the point process operation meet certain mathematical conditions, then as point process operations are applied to the process, then often the resulting point process will behave stochastically more like a Poisson point process if it has a non-random mean measure, which gives the average number of points of the point process located in some region. In other words, in the limit as the number of operations applied approaches infinity, the point process will converge in distribution (or weakly) to a Poisson point process or, if its measure is a random measure, to a Cox point process.  Convergence results, such as the Palm-Khinchin theorem for renewal processes, are then also used to justify the use of the Poisson point process as a mathematical of various phenomena.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Point process notation ==\\\\n\\\\nPoint processes are mathematical objects that can be used to represent collections of points randomly scattered on some underlying mathematical space. They have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of point process notation.  For example, if a point \\\\n  \\\\n    \\\\n      \\\\n        \\\\n          x\\\\n        \\\\n      \\\\n    \\\\n    {\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\textstyle x}\\\\n   belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by \\\\n  \\\\n    \\\\n      \\\\n        \\\\n          \\\\n            N\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n      \\\\n    \\\\n    {\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\textstyle {N}}\\\\n  , then this can be written as:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\n    \\\\n      \\\\n        \\\\n          x\\\\n          ∈\\\\n          \\\\n            N\\\\n          \\\\n          ,\\\\n        \\\\n      \\\\n    \\\\n    {\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\textstyle x\\\\\\\\in {N},}\\\\n  and represents the point process as a random set.

These operations can be purely random, deterministic or both, and are used to construct new point processes, which can be then also used as mathematical models. The operations may include removing or thinning points from a point process, combining or superimposing multiple point processes into one point process or transforming the underlying space of the point process into another space. Point process operations and the resulting point processes are used in the theory of point processes and related fields such as stochastic geometry and spatial statistics.One point process that gives particularly convenient results under random point process operations is the Poisson point process, The Poisson point process often exhibits a type of mathematical closure such that when a point process operation is applied to some Poisson point process, then provided some conditions on the point process operation, the resulting process will be often another Poisson point process operation, hence it is often used as a mathematical model.Point process operations have been studied in the mathematical limit as the number of random point process operations applied approaches infinity. This had led to convergence theorems of point process operations, which have their origins in the pioneering work of Conny Palm in 1940s and later Aleksandr Khinchin in the 1950s and 1960s who both studied point processes on the real line, in the context of studying the arrival of phone calls and queueing theory in general. Provided that the original point process and the point process operation meet certain mathematical conditions, then as point process operations are applied to the process, then often the resulting point process will behave stochastically more like a Poisson point process if it has a non-random mean measure, which gives the average number of points of the point process located in some region. In other words, in the limit as the number of operations applied approaches infinity, the point process will converge in distribution (or weakly) to a Poisson point process or, if its measure is a random measure, to a Cox point process.  Convergence results, such as the Palm-Khinchin theorem for renewal processes, are then also used to justify the use of the Poisson point process as a mathematical of various phenomena.\\', \\'source\\': \\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_process_operation\\'}), Document(page_content=\"In probability, statistics and related fields, a Poisson point process is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space with the essential feature that the points occur independently of one another.

In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. Modeling a system as a Poisson Process is insufficient when the point-to-point interactions are too strong (i.e. the points are not stochastically independent). Such a system may be better modeled with a different point process.The point process depends on a single mathematical object, which, depending on the context, may be a constant, a locally integrable function or, in more general settings, a Radon measure. In the first case, the constant, known as the rate or intensity, is the average density of the points in the Poisson process located in some region of space.
