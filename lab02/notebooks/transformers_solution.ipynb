    "# Introduction to the 🤗 `transformers` library\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, we are going to use the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) today.\n",
    "Let's start with some numbers. At the time of writing, the Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and 150k demo apps.\n",
    "Everything is open source and publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the Hugging Face Hub uses git-based repositories. While you can directly interact with Hub repos as you would with any other git repo, we will be using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing the transformers library is as easy as\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need your favourite deep learning framework (`torch` or `tensorflow`). Today you don't have to worry about dependencies, we've already added everything to the `environment.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "With `transformers`, all (NLP) models are a line away from being used. You can choose between a high- and a low-level API, depending on how you want to use them.\n",
    "On the highest level, there is the `pipeline` function. `pipeline` can be used for most tasks across different modalities. Here are some examples, you can find the complete list in the [`transformers` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline).\n",
